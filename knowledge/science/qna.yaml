seed_examples:
  - context: >-
      As per the EU AI Act, financial institutions using AI-driven decision-making for loan approvals must ensure transparency, fairness,
      and non-discrimination. The Act mandates that high-risk AI systems undergo rigorous bias testing and explainability review.
      Moreover, AI models must incorporate human oversight (Article 16) and maintain clear documentation along with regular risk assessments
      (Article 53) to enable effective regulatory audits. Customers have the right to contest automated decisions as provided in Article 16.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What are the key compliance requirements for AI-driven financial products under the EU AI Act, and does our product comply?
        answer: >-
          AI-driven financial products must ensure transparency, fairness, and non-discrimination. High-risk AI systems must undergo regular bias
          testing and risk assessments (Article 53) while providing human oversight (Article 16). If our loan approval model includes structured
          bias audits, documented risk management procedures, and a mechanism for customer appeals as prescribed by Article 16, it complies;
          any missing component would indicate non-compliance with these sections.
      - question: How does the EU AI Act address bias in AI-based loan approvals, and what would cause a product to be non-compliant?
        answer: >-
          The Act requires that financial institutions perform rigorous bias testing and document mitigation measures (Article 53). A product
          becomes non-compliant if it fails to conduct regular bias assessments or lacks transparent documentation and oversight (Article 16).
      - question: >-
          What rights do customers have under the EU AI Act regarding AI-driven financial decisions, and how can we verify our product supports these rights?
        answer: >-
          Customers have the right to contest automated decisions and request human intervention as stated in Article 16. Verification involves ensuring
          that our products documentation includes processes for human oversight and avenues for redress, meeting the standards set out in Article 16.
  - context: >-
      The EU AI Act classifies certain financial AI applications, such as algorithmic trading, credit risk assessments, and loan approvals,
      as high-risk systems. Such systems are subject to strict transparency and explainability requirements (Article 52), as well as robust
      risk management practices (Article 53). Non-compliance with these standards may result in significant regulatory penalties.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What AI applications in finance are considered high-risk under the EU AI Act, and does our system fully comply with these requirements?
        answer: >-
          The Act designates credit risk assessments, algorithmic trading, and AI-based loan approvals as high-risk systems, governed mainly by
          Articles 52 and 53. Full compliance requires that these applications incorporate comprehensive risk management, transparency, and human oversight
          (Article 16). Our system must adhere to all these provisions to be compliant.
      - question: >-
          What are the regulatory expectations for high-risk AI systems in financial services, and how can our platform demonstrate compliance?
        answer: >-
          High-risk systems must provide full transparency regarding their decision processes (Article 52), implement continuous risk assessments and bias audits
          (Article 53), and include mandatory human oversight (Article 16). Our platform should document these processes thoroughly to demonstrate compliance.
      - question: >-
          What penalties can financial institutions face for non-compliance with the EU AI Act regarding high-risk AI applications?
        answer: >-
          Non-compliance can lead to substantial fines, restrictions on market deployment, and mandatory corrective actions as defined in the penalty provisions
          of the Act. These penalties are intended to enforce the strict requirements laid out in Articles 52, 53, and 16.
  - context: >-
      Under the EU AI Act, financial institutions must disclose when financial product recommendations are generated using AI. Transparency is mandated
      by Article 52, which requires that customers be informed about the AI role in decision-making. Additionally, Article 53 reinforces that key decision
      factors must be documented and accessible, ensuring the fairness and explainability of the recommendations. Institutions must also allow customers to
      opt out and seek human advice as per Article 16.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          What disclosure requirements apply to AI-driven financial product recommendations, and does our recommendation system comply with these requirements?
        answer: >-
          Financial institutions must notify customers of AI involvement in generating recommendations (Article 52) and ensure that the decision-making factors
          are clearly documented (Article 53). Moreover, customers must have the right to opt out as provided in Article 16. Our system complies if it includes clear
          AI involvement notifications, transparent explanation of the underlying rationale, and an opt-out mechanism.
      - question: >-
          How should AI-driven pricing mechanisms be communicated to customers to ensure compliance with the EU AI Act?
        answer: >-
          The Act requires that pricing mechanisms driven by AI are transparent (Article 52). Institutions must clearly outline the factors influencing
          pricing decisions and ensure that customers understand these mechanisms. Without such transparency, the system would not meet the fairness requirements.
      - question: >-
          Can customers opt out of AI-based financial recommendations under the EU AI Act, and what is required for compliance?
        answer: >-
          Yes, customers must be provided with an opt-out option (Article 16). Compliance involves informing users of the AIâ€™s involvement in decision-making
          and offering a clear, accessible process for opting out, ensuring that customers can request human-based advice if desired.
  - context: >-
      The EU AI Act designates AI-driven financial services such as credit scoring and risk assessments as high-risk systems that require strict compliance
      with transparency, explainability, and human oversight measures. As outlined in Article 53, financial AI models must undergo bias audits and maintain
      detailed risk management documentation, while Article 16 mandates the inclusion of human oversight in decision-making processes.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          Our mortgage product uses AI for credit assessment, with integrated risk management and human oversight. Does it comply with the EU AI Act,
          and which articles confirm its compliance?
        answer: >-
          The product is compliant if it fulfills the risk management and bias auditing requirements of Article 53 and includes the mandatory human oversight
          provisions specified in Article 16. These articles ensure that the credit assessment process is transparent, regularly monitored, and subject to human review.
      - question: >-
          Our lending platform uses an AI-driven credit scoring model that evaluates customer profiles autonomously without manual review. Does this system
          comply, and if not, which sections would it be violating?
        answer: >-
          The system does not fully comply as the absence of human oversight violates the mandates of Article 16. Moreover, without documented bias testing and
          risk assessments as required by Article 53, the model fails to meet the transparency and accountability standards set by the Act.
      - question: >-
          We use an AI-powered fraud detection system that monitors transactions in real time without human involvement. Does our system comply with the Act,
          and what regulatory measures must be in place?
        answer: >-
          AI-driven fraud detection must incorporate human oversight and ensure transparency in decision-making processes per Articles 52 and 53.
          Compliance requires that flagged transactions are subject to human review to mitigate risks, otherwise the system would be non-compliant.
  - context: >-
      The EU AI Act requires transparency and explainability in all AI-driven financial product recommendations. Financial institutions must notify customers
      of AI involvement and allow them to opt out, as required by Article 52. Additionally, AI models in investment and lending must disclose key decision
      factors under Article 53, and consumers must have the right to contest decisions as provided in Article 16.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: >-
          Our investment platform recommends portfolios using an AI-driven risk assessment model that provides optimized asset allocations based on customers' financial goals.
          Does our platform comply with the EU AI Act, and which articles indicate either compliance or non-compliance?
        answer: >-
          The platform complies if it meets the transparency and explainability requirements of Article 52 and the risk management and documentation provisions
          of Article 53, as well as the customer rights under Article 16. Missing any of these key elements would render the system non-compliant.
      - question: >-
          We use AI to determine loan interest rates based on dynamic risk factors, adjusting pricing in real time without disclosing this process to customers.
          Does this system comply with the EU AI Act, and what sections are being violated?
        answer: >-
          This system is non-compliant because it fails to meet the transparency requirements set out in Article 52, which mandate that customers must be informed
          about AI role in pricing decisions. Without disclosure of the key pricing factors, the system violates the fairness and transparency provisions.
      - question: >-
          Our AI-driven personal finance assistant provides automated budgeting and savings recommendations without human oversight.
          Is this compliant under the EU AI Act, and which articles determine the compliance status?
        answer: >-
          Although a personal finance assistant might not be classified as high-risk, it must still adhere to the transparency requirements of Article 52
          and ensure explainability as per Article 53. Moreover, to safeguard consumer rights under Article 16, the assistant should offer human intervention
          options. Without these measures, the system would be partially non-compliant.
